This ClojureScript library provides a API for interacting with [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) nodes.
<!-- It uses a [bridge pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) to decouple its API from the subsequent implementations, allowing the latter to vary at runtime. -->

<!-- In practice what this means is that future versions of the library will maintain the same function signatures and behaviour, it also means that anyone can provide a suitable implementation in this library, or opt-in to use the API in own. -->

### <a name="core"></a>`cljs-web3.core`

Core functions which deal with creating and checking the status of Web3 connections.

#### <a name="websocket-provider" >`websocket-provider`

This function is the gateway to using the library.
Most other functions will take the map it returns as their first argument, unless specified otherwise.

It creates a Web3 instance over a websocket connection.
Takes an the url and a map of options as parameters.
Returns a the websocket (the provider)

Example:

```clojure
(ns my-district
  (:require [cljs-web3.core :as web3-core]
            [web3.impl.web3js :as web3js]))

(def web3 (web3-core/websocket-provider "ws://127.0.0.1:8545" {:client-config {:max-received-frame-size 100000000
                                                                               :max-received-message-size 100000000}}))
```

#### <a name="http-provider">`http-provider`

Similar to [websocket-provider](#websocket-provider), but creates a Web3 instance from a URL address.

*NOTE* some functions, notably subscriptions (see e.g. [subscribe-events](#subscribe-events)), will work differently with than `http-provider`, which is why it's generally recommended to use the [websocket](#websocket-provider) connections for your subscriptions.

#### <a name="extend">`extend`

Allows for extending the Web3 object with any supported [JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#json-rpc-methods) method, which is otherwise not a part of this library.
Takes as arguments:
- a map returned by the [websocket-provider](#websocket-provider) or [http-provider](#http-provider) function.
- the module name (a keyword)
- a colection of `method` maps with following keys:
  - `name` : Name of the method to add
  - `call` : The RPC method name
  - `params` : The number of parameters for that call (optional)

Example:

```clojure
(extend web3
 :evm
 [{:name "increaseTime"
   :call "evm_increaseTime"
   :params 1})])
```

Returns the same web3 map as passed, but now the provider is extended with the [`increaseTime`]() method in the `evm` module, which you can invoke like this:

```clojure
(.increaseTime (aget web3 :provider "evm") 1000)
```

#### <a name="connection-url" >`connection-url`

Takes as arguments a map returned by the [provider](#websocket-provider) function and returns the URL of the node it is connected to.

```clojure
(connection-url web3)
;; "ws://127.0.0.1:8545"
```

#### <a name="connected?">`connected?`

Takes as arguments a map returned by the [provider](#websocket-provider) function and returns the connection status as a boolean value.
This function is synchronous, for an asynchronous method see [is-listening?](@is-listening?).

#### <a name="disconnect">`disconnect`

Immediately disconnects the [provider](#websocket-provider), returns `nil`.

```clojure
(disconnect web3)
```

#### <a name="on-connect">`on-connect`

Takes a [provider](#websocket-provider) map and a callback function as arguments, callback is executed when the connection is established.

```clojure
(web3-core/on-connect web3 (fn [event] (prn "just connected")))
```

#### <a name="on-disconnect">`on-disconnect`

Takes a [provider](#websocket-provider) map and a callback as arguments, callback is executed when the connection is dropped.

```clojure
(web3-core/on-disconnect web3 (fn [event] (prn "your web3 socket has lost its connection")))
```

#### <a name="on-error">`on-error`

Similar as [on-connect](#on-connect) and [on-disconnect](#on-disconnect) but executes the callback when connection throws an error.

### <a name="eth" >`cljs-web3.eth`

This namespace contains functions for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts.

#### <a name= "is-listening?">`is-listening?`

Asynchronous version of the [connected?](#connected?) function, takes the [provider](#websocket-provider) map and a callback function.
Returns a JS/Promise which returns a boolean.

You can use it to set a periodically executing connection healthcheck:

```clojure
(js/setInterval (fn []
                  (is-listening? web3
                                 (fn [_ connected?]
                                   (when-not connected?
                                     (reset-connection)))))
                3000)
```

Returns a Contract instance.

```
(def abi (aget (.readFileSync js/fs MyContract.json) "abi))

#### <a name= "subscribe-logs">`subscribe-logs`

This function lets you create subscriptions listening to specific logs of things happening on the blockchain, filtered by a given list of topics.

It takes as arguments:
- the [provider](#websocket-provider) map
- map of options:
  - `:from-block` : the block number (greater than or equal to) from which to get events on.
  - `:address` : a string or a vector of strings with addresses to listen to
  - `:topics` : An vector of values which must each appear in the log entries. Order needs to match the order in the `:address` vector.

                {:address [address]
                 :topics [event-signature]
                 :from-block block-number}
                (fn [_ event] (prn event))
```

Similar to the [subscribe-events](#subscribe-events) function, it returns an `EventEmitter` which can be augmented using [on](#on).

#### <a name= "decode-log">`decode-log`

Use this function to decodes an ABI encoded log data and indexed topic data, such as returned by the [subscribe-logs](#subscribe-logs) subscription.

Arguments:
- the [provider](#websocket-provider) map
`abi` : a map of interface inputs array
`data` : the abi bytecode of the data field in the log (a string)
`topics` : a vector of the topics of the log (see [subscribe-logs](#subscribe-logs))

#### <a name= "on">`on`

This function can be used with the `EventEmitter` returned by the [subscribe-events](#subscribe-events) and [subscribe-logs](#subscribe-logs).
It will add callbacks executed on specific events:
- `:connected`: fires the callback when the subscription is created, returns the id of that subscription as the first argument of the callback
- `:data` : fired on each incoming log with the log object as argument. If the subscription happens ot be listening to a smart event contract the event passed as th ecallback argument is the same as for the [subscribe-events](#subscribe-events).
- `:changed` : fires when the log is removed from the blockchain
- `:error` : fires when an error in the subscription occurs.

```clojure
(-> event-emitter
    (#(on web3 % :connected (fn [sub-id]
                              (prn "subscribed to SetCounterEvents. Subscription id :" sub-id))))
    (#(on web3 % :data (fn [event]
                         (prn "new SetCounterEvents :" event))))

 ```

#### <a name= "clear-subscriptions">`clear-subscriptions`

Clears all created subscription.

#### <a name= "get-past-events">`get-past-events`

Returns all past events for the specified contract.

It takes as arguments:
- the [provider](#websocket-provider) map
- smart contract instance, as returned by the [contract-at](#contract-at) function
- the CamelCased keyword with the name of the smart contracts event to replay
- map of options:
  - `:from-block` : the block number (greater than or equal to) from which to return the events
  - `:to-block` : the block number (less than or equal to) up to which the events are returned
- a nodejs-style callback function (`error` is a first parameters and `response` the second), executed each time the event is seen (optional)

```clojure
(web3-eth/get-past-events web3
                          my-contract
                          :SetCounterEvent
